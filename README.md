High concept: Based on the popular kids imagination game “The Floor is Lava” with a “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” twist, Lava Drop is an escape-the-room, physics-based puzzle game for kids 8 years old and up. It introduces the STEM concepts of Newtonian physics, trigonometry, and engineering in the exciting context of zip line construction within a lava-filled house.

Storyline: The Lava Drop story follows two siblings who sneak into their dad’s laboratory in the attic of their house. The kids turn on a faulty shrink ray that not only shrinks them, but also breaks a container full of orange goop, causing a chemical reaction that floods the house and turns the floors into lava. Now the kids are too small to jump on furniture to escape the house – they must use material from the lab to zip line out of the house!

Gameplay: The goal on any single level in Lava Drop is to get from the starting platform to the escape door without hitting the walls, touching the lava, or becoming stagnant before reaching the escape door. Every level has a different layout of snap points, which serves as our core puzzle element. In build mode, the player engineers a zip line course by drawing lines between snap points. It’s not as simple as connecting the dots, because the player is given a limit on the length of any line segment they’re allowed to create. When the player is ready to test their zip line course, a click on the play button will animate their avatar along the path they’ve engineered. A successful zip line course earns a score based on the time it takes to traverse – the faster the time, the higher the score.
